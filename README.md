# Data-Analytics
---

## Welcome to the Data Analytics repository! This repository contains resources and tools for analyzing data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the data analytics tools in this repository, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
* Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/data-analytics.git
```
* Install the required dependencies using pip:
* Copy code
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run the analysis scripts to start analyzing your data.

## Common Issues

* ValueError: time data 'nan' does not match format '%d/%m/%Y'
If you encounter this error when trying to convert a string type date into a datetime format using pandas, it means that the string you are trying to parse is "Not a Number" or "Not a valid number". This can happen if you are trying to parse an invalid date string or if you have a nan value in your data.

* To fix this error, make sure that the date string you are trying to parse is in the correct format. The format specified in your code, '%d/%m/%Y', expects the date to be in the format "day/month/year", so make sure that the string you are trying to parse follows this format.

* If you have a nan value in your data, you can handle it by using the pd.to_datetime function with the errors parameter set to 'coerce'. This will convert any invalid date strings or nan values to NaT (Not a Time), which is a special value in pandas that represents a missing or null datetime.
